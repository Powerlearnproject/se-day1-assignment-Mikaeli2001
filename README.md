# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is a branch of computer science which is used for developing, maintaining and testing of software
importance include:
flexibility where systems handle many functions without affecting perfomance
security where it is enhanced practices like authentification


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering machine
complexity



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning where you identify requirements, scope and purpose
design which involves building a framework
requirement analysis where you identify final user specification
coding this refers to converting software design into code
testing where you examine the software for any bugs



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is a sequential project management, each phase is completed before moving on. example inlude in a highly controlled processes like in construction where it starts from blueprints to actual work.
agile methodology is an iterative approach project management. examples where applicable is in mobile and web development where it allows for frequent updates



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer -developing systems using programming languages and frameworks.
quality assurance engineer -create development standards for programmers to follow.
project manager -create blueprint for the project and leads the software development team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs intergrate various debugging tools that show bugs even as the developer is typing. e.g vs code
VCS enable collaboration by allowing developers to work on the same codebase. eg Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
rapid advancement in technology which puts alot of pressure on developers. solution is to adopt contionous learning practices to keep up with emerging trends.
time constraints where developers work under pressures to meet deadlines. solution is dividing large projects into manageable mini projects.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit test, this tests individual methods and functions of the classes. ensures each unit performs its intended purpose correctly.
intergration test, this verifies if the different modules in the application work well together. helps to ensure data flows smoothly between modules.
system test, focuseds on the entire software. helps verify if the system meets all functional requirements.
acceptance test, determines if system is ready for use. helps ensure if the system meets business requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of generating desired outputs from generative AI solutions
importance include:
AI can help in brainstorming and generating creative content.
can automate repetitive tasks freeing up developers time for more complex work.
can explain complex concepts


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
write a 3 stanza poem about negative climate change implications in central kenya
clarity -3 stanza poem
specific -negative climate change implications
concise - additional details provide a clear picture
